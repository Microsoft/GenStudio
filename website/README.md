# Build the website
Follow these steps to build the website. Note that many of the APIs are referenced within the site code and will need to be changed if you are deploying a full version of the site. 

## Available Scripts

The first time you work with the code, navigate to `website\deep-art` and install our dependencies with:

### `npm install`


Once the dependencies are installed, start the website with:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
